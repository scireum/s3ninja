    <p>Basically all object methods are supported. However no ACLs are checked. If the bucket is public, everyone can
        its contents.
        Otherwise a valid hash has to be provided as Authorization header. The hash will be checked as
        expected by amazon, but no multiline-headers are supported yet. (Multi-value headers are supported).
